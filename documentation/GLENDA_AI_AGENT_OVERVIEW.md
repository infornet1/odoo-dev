# Glenda — AI Agent Overview

**Version:** 17.0.1.41.4 | **Status:** Production ✅ | **Date:** 2026-05-14

## What Is Glenda

Glenda is a WhatsApp AI agent (powered by Claude Haiku 4.5) that contacts parents whose emails bounced, resolves the issue via conversation, and triggers automated post-processing across 4 external systems (Odoo, Freescout, Google Sheets, Akdemia).

She operates as "Glenda, asistente de Colegio Andres Bello" — a warm, professional Venezuelan Spanish-speaking assistant.

**Cost:** ~$0.005 per conversation (~1,000 conversations per $5 credit).

---

## Conversation Flow

1. **Initiation** — Operator clicks "Iniciar WhatsApp" on a bounce log record. Glenda sends a personalized greeting in Venezuelan Spanish.
2. **Negotiation** — She explains the email problem, asks for an alternative, handles objections, stays on-topic.
3. **Resolution** — One of 6 possible outcomes (see Resolution Paths below).
4. **Post-processing** — Automated bridge scripts update Freescout, Google Sheets, and flag Akdemia changes.

### Contact Schedule

Glenda's schedule behavior depends on the skill:

| Skill | Schedule |
|-------|----------|
| `bounce_resolution`, `bill_reminder`, `billing_support`, `hr_data_collection`, `payslip_ack_reminder` | Business hours only (see below) |
| `general_inquiry` | **24/7 — no schedule restriction** |

**Business hours (VET, GMT-4):**

| Day | Hours |
|-----|-------|
| Weekdays | 06:30 - 20:30 |
| Weekends & Holidays | 09:30 - 19:00 |

Customer-initiated replies to business-hours skills are also processed anytime (webhook path). The schedule gates cron-driven outbound only.

| **Limitations** | Text only (no flyers/media). No balance lookups. No external contact routing |
| **Fallback** | Any error → default OdooBot response. `dry_run=True` → default OdooBot |

---

## General Inquiry Skill (v1.26.0+)

Glenda now handles **unsolicited inbound messages** — when an unknown phone sends a WhatsApp to the Glenda number with no active conversation. This uses the `general_inquiry` skill which operates 24/7 (no schedule restriction).

### What She Does

1. Greets the person warmly, introduces herself as an assistant of the school.
2. Identifies the contact in Odoo (by phone number). If recognized, addresses them by name.
3. Answers general questions using institutional knowledge: monthly fees, payment methods, bank accounts, Zelle, Binance, Mercantil portal.
4. Routes complex or personal inquiries to the human team via email handoff.

### Handoff Routing

| Route | Inquiry Type | Routed To |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| `billing` | Billing / debt / balance / payment adjustments | `pagos@ueipab.edu.ve` (Pagos y Facturación) |
| `support` | Documents, student matters, complaints, general support | `soporte@ueipab.edu.ve` (Soporte) |
| `pdvsa_retention` | Existing 2025-2026 PDVSA/Petropiar family expressing economic hardship | `pagos@ueipab.edu.ve` — **urgent** alert email |

On handoff, Glenda sends a detailed email to the appropriate team with: customer phone, name, Odoo contact status, inquiry summary, and the full conversation transcript.

For `pdvsa_retention` route, the subject is prefixed with `[URGENTE - Glenda] Familia PDVSA — Riesgo de no renovación` and includes a risk summary and required action prompt.

### PDVSA / Petropiar Policy (v1.29.7)

The 35% credit advance benefit offered in 2025-2026 has been **discontinued for 2026-2027**.

| Scenario | Who | Glenda's Behavior |
|----------|-----|-------------------|
| **A — New prospect** | Employee of PDVSA/Petropiar with no prior enrollment | Explains discontinuation clearly but cordially. 100% upfront at BCV rate. Handoff to `billing` |
| **B — Existing distressed family** | Enrolled in 2025-2026, expressing "no puedo pagar", "voy a salir", etc. | Responds with maximum empathy and calm. Affirms the school values their family. Invites Director meeting. Fires urgent retention alert (`pdvsa_retention`) |

### Promotional Flyers (v1.29.0)

When a customer's question matches a topic covered by a promotional flyer (inscriptions, tuition, extracurricular courses, payment methods), Glenda sends the relevant flyer image via WhatsApp alongside her text reply.

| Flyer Key | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| `inscripcion` | Inscripciones abiertas 2026-2027 — $197.38/año, 17.72% descuento hasta 1 mayo |
| `pronto_pago` | Mensualidad congelada a $162.39 si pagas en los primeros 10 días del mes |
| `tarjeta_credito` | Tarjetas de crédito nacionales e internacionales sin comisiones |
| `english` | MOA School: Cursos de Inglés After School, $38/mes |
| `robotica` | Robótica con Kurios — 2 clases/semana, $52/mes |
| `dibujo` | Curso de Dibujo y Pintura — 3 meses, 4h semanales, $38/mes |
| `bachillerato_virtual` | Bachillerato Virtual 100% online |

Flyer images are hosted at `https://dev.ueipab.edu.ve/flyers/` (nginx-served, public).

> **⚠️ Known Limitation (as of 2026-04-01):** The MassivaMóvil API accepts `type=photo` requests with status 200 and queues them, but images are **not delivered** to the WhatsApp end user. Confirmed through multiple tests. Awaiting MassivaMóvil tech support clarification. The code infrastructure is fully in place — once the API issue is resolved (or a hyperlink-based fallback is implemented), flyer delivery will work automatically.

### Trigger

The 24h cooldown guard prevents re-triggering a general_inquiry conversation too quickly for the same number. After 24h of inactivity, a new inquiry from the same number creates a fresh conversation.

---

## Automated Infrastructure (10 Processes)

### Odoo Crons (Inside the Module)

| Cron | Interval | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Poll WhatsApp Messages** | 5 min | Picks up customer WhatsApp replies from MassivaMóvil API |
| **Check Conversation Timeouts** | 1 hour | 24h gentle follow-up, 48h final notice, 72h auto-close |
| **Credit Guard** | 30 min | Monitors WA sends + Claude spend, kill switch if depleted |
| **Archive Attachments** | 2 hours | Downloads and archives WA attachment images before MassivaMóvil URL expiry |
| **Stagger HR Data Collection** | 30 min | Starts draft `hr_data_collection` conversations respecting capacity + schedule |
| **Stagger Payslip Ack Reminders** | 30 min | Starts draft `payslip_ack_reminder` conversations respecting capacity + schedule |
| **Auto-Resolve Ack Reminders** | 30 min | Detects `is_acknowledged=True` on linked payslip → auto-closes conversation |

### System Crons (Scripts on Dev Server)

| Cron | Interval | Script | Purpose |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Escalation Bridge** | 5 min | `ai_agent_escalation_bridge.py` | Creates Freescout tickets + WA group alerts for off-topic requests |
| **Resolution Bridge** | 5 min | `ai_agent_resolution_bridge.py` | Post-processes resolved BLs → Freescout close/assign, Sheets update, DSN cleanup, Akdemia check, family context |
| **Email Checker** | 15 min | `ai_agent_email_checker.py` | Detects when customer replies to verification email in Freescout |
| **WA Health Monitor** | 15 min | `ai_agent_wa_health_monitor.py` | Detects SPAM flagging, auto-switches to backup WhatsApp number |
| **Bounce Processor** | Daily 05:00 | `daily_bounce_processor.py` | Detects new bounces from Freescout, creates bounce logs in Odoo |
| **Akdemia Pipeline** | Daily 06:00 | `customer_matching_daily.py` | Scrapes fresh parent data from Akdemia, detects email changes, auto-resolves matches |
| **Akdemia Email Sync** | (part of pipeline) | `akdemia_email_sync.py` | Compares Akdemia XLS with bounce logs, auto-resolves where emails changed |

---

## Systems Glenda Touches

| System | How | What Changes |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| **Odoo** (res.partner) | Direct (module) | Bounced email removed, new email added, chatter audit trail |
| **Odoo** (mailing.contact) | Direct (module) | Email updated across all mailing lists (Toda la comunidad, Grupo1) |
| **Odoo** (mail.bounce.log) | Direct (module) | State transitions, resolution data, family context JSON |
| **Freescout** | MySQL (bridge script) | Conversation subject prefix `[RESUELTO-AI]`, internal notes, close/assign, DSN customer reassignment |
| **Google Sheets** | API (bridge script) | Customers tab: remove bounced email from column J |
| **WhatsApp** | MassivaMóvil API | Send/receive messages, group alerts |
| **Akdemia** | Read-only (scraper) | Data source for family context, email change detection, auto-resolve |

---

## Safety Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **dry_run mode** | Default on. Read-only toggle in dashboard with confirmation buttons to prevent accidental activation |
| **active_db safeguard** | Only the database matching `ai_agent.active_db` parameter processes crons. Prevents double-processing when testing and production share the same WhatsApp account |
| **Credit Guard** | Auto-blocks outbound API calls when WA sends or Claude spend approach limits. Auto-recovers on next passing check. API errors = treat as depleted (fail-safe) |
| **Contact schedule** | Cron-initiated outbound blocked outside business hours |
| **Anti-spam interval** | Minimum 120-140 seconds between WhatsApp sends (MassivaMóvil recommended) |
| **WA health monitor** | Dual-layer detection (API validation + Freescout email scan) with automatic failover to backup number |
| **Kill switch** | `ai_agent.credits_ok` parameter — when False, all outbound WhatsApp + Claude calls are blocked |
| **Deduplication** | `whatsapp_message_id` prevents processing the same incoming message twice |
| **Known-bounced cross-check** | Akdemia auto-resolve skips emails that are themselves in the bounced list |

---

## Results (as of 2026-02-14)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total bounce logs | 37 |
| Resolved | 22 (59%) |
| Akdemia pending | 4 (11%) |
| Active conversations | 5 (14%) |
| Pending (not contacted) | 5 (14%) |
| Orphans (no partner match) | 8 |
| Auto-resolved via Akdemia (no WhatsApp) | ~17 |
| First full live resolution | BL#39 DAYANA PERDOMO (11 messages, 8 related DSN convs closed) |
| Message batching verified | BL#42 EDDA RODRIGUEZ |
| Family context populated | 11 bounce logs with Akdemia family data |

## Active Skills (v1.31.0)

| Skill Code | Name | Source Model | Status | Max Turns | Schedule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bounce_resolution` | Resolución de Rebotes | `mail.bounce.log` | Production-ready | 5 | Business hours |
| `bill_reminder` | Recordatorio de Factura | `account.move` | Implemented, not yet used | 3 | Business hours |
| `billing_support` | Soporte de Facturación | `res.partner` | Implemented, not yet used | 4 | Business hours |
| `general_inquiry` | Consulta General | *(inbound)* | Production-ready | 25 | 24/7 |
| `hr_data_collection` | Recolección de Datos HR | `hr.data.collection.request` | Testing | 30 | Business hours |
| `payslip_ack_reminder` | Recordatorio de Conformidad | `hr.payslip` | Testing (v1.31.0) | 4 | Business hours |

### `payslip_ack_reminder` skill (v1.31.0)

- **Trigger:** HR opens payslip batch → "Recolección de Datos" wizard Tab 2 → selects unacknowledged payslips → creates draft conversations
- **Greeting:** Identifies Glenda as *"la agente de asistencia virtual"* (virtual agent, not real staff), payslip number + period + net VEB amount, directs to institutional email — **no direct portal link**
- **Escalation:** Any employee concern → `ACTION:ESCALATE:desc` → email to `recursoshumanos@ueipab.edu.ve` with conversation transcript + Odoo link → conversation auto-closes
- **Auto-resolve:** `_cron_check_ack_acknowledged()` detects `is_acknowledged=True` on linked payslip, closes conversation automatically
- **Timeout:** 48h, 1 reminder at 24h

---

## Current Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Potential Enhancement |
|------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Manual initiation only** | Operator must click "Iniciar WhatsApp" for each bounce log | Batch initiation wizard with smart scheduling |
| **Generic bounce reason greeting** | Same greeting regardless of whether bounce is mailbox_full vs. domain_not_found | Tailored greetings per bounce reason |
| **No conversation analytics** | No dashboard with turns-to-resolution, response times, resolution type distribution | Analytics tab in dashboard |
| **No retry for timed-out conversations** | Failed conversations (72h no reply) are not retried | Auto-retry after 1-2 weeks with different approach |
| **No proactive email suggestion** | Even when Akdemia shows the same parent has a different (working) email, Glenda doesn't suggest it | Use family context to proactively offer the Akdemia email |

## Production Readiness Review (Updated 2026-04-19)

### Deployment Model

All 7 system cron scripts run on the **dev server** (where Freescout MySQL is local). For production, they STAY on the dev server — only `TARGET_ENV` changes to `production` so they point Odoo XML-RPC at `https://odoo.ueipab.edu.ve` / `DB_UEIPAB`. Freescout/Sheets/WhatsApp connections remain unchanged.

```
                  DEV SERVER (10.124.0.2)                    PROD SERVER (10.124.0.3)

### Gap Analysis

#### GAP 0: Hardcoded Credentials in Bridge Scripts — SECURITY CRITICAL BLOCKER *(NEW 2026-04-19)*

`ai_agent_escalation_bridge.py` and `ai_agent_resolution_bridge.py` (and `ai_agent_email_checker.py`) contain production Odoo XML-RPC passwords and Freescout MySQL password hardcoded as default fallback values in source code:

```python
ODOO_CONFIGS = {
    'production': {
        'password': 'f69330e5bd6ae043320f054e9df9fcbbb34522db',  # ← EXPOSED
    }
}
FREESCOUT_DB_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('FREESCOUT_DB_PASSWORD', '1gczp1S@3!')  # ← EXPOSED
```

**Required fixes before production go-live:**
1. Remove all hardcoded credential fallbacks — raise `RuntimeError` if env var missing
2. Create `/root/.odoo_agent_env_prod` (chmod 600) on dev server with production credentials
3. Update all crontab entries to source this file before script execution
4. Rotate both production Odoo user API key and Freescout MySQL password
5. Audit git history — revoke any compromised credentials

**Crontab pattern (after fix):**
```bash
*/5 * * * * root . /root/.odoo_agent_env_prod && python3 /opt/odoo-dev/scripts/ai_agent_escalation_bridge.py >> /var/log/ai_agent_escalation_prod.log 2>&1
```

---

#### GAP 1: Odoo Modules Not Installed in Production — BLOCKER

Three modules must be installed in order (dependency chain):

| Module | Version | Required By | Prod Status |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `ueipab_hr_employee` | (latest) | `ueipab_ai_agent` depends | **NOT FOUND** on prod addons path |
| `ueipab_bounce_log` | 17.0.1.4.0 | `ueipab_ai_agent` depends | **NOT FOUND** on prod addons path |
| `ueipab_ai_agent` | 17.0.1.31.0 | Primary module | **NOT FOUND** on prod addons path |

**Already installed in prod (no action):** `contacts`, `mail`, `mass_mailing`, `account`, `hr`, `hr_payroll_community`.

**Action:** Copy all 3 modules to `/home/vision/ueipab17/addons/`. Install in order: `ueipab_hr_employee` → `ueipab_bounce_log` → `ueipab_ai_agent`.

#### GAP 2: Config Files Missing on Production

| File | Needed By | Location on Dev | Production Path |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `whatsapp_massiva.json` | Module (post_init_hook) + escalation/health scripts | `/opt/odoo-dev/config/` | `/home/vision/ueipab17/config/` |
| `anthropic_api.json` | Module (post_init_hook) | `/opt/odoo-dev/config/` | `/home/vision/ueipab17/config/` |
| `google_sheets_credentials.json` | Bridge scripts only (dev server) | `/opt/odoo-dev/config/` | **N/A — stays on dev server** |

**Note:** Config files no longer exist on dev filesystem (deleted after initial load). Values are stored in `ir.config_parameter`. For production, either: (a) recreate JSON files temporarily for `post_init_hook`, or (b) manually set ~30 `ai_agent.*` system parameters after install.

**Action:** Recreate JSON config files on production server before module install. Remove after `post_init_hook` loads values.

#### GAP 3: Webhook — Enhancement for Real-Time Response *(partially resolved 2026-04-19)*

**Current state:** MassivaMóvil webhook configured. Testing endpoint active. Production nginx proxy block still pending.

**MassivaMóvil webhook (configured 2026-04-19):**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Webhook name | `glenda_ai_agent.whatsapp` |
| Secret | `30803885a4b55d0dac0b88f54459e885ff0af838` (same as `api.secret`) |
| Testing callback URL | `http://dev.ueipab.edu.ve:8019/ai-agent/webhook/whatsapp` |
| Production callback URL | `https://odoo.ueipab.edu.ve/ai-agent/webhook/whatsapp` *(pending nginx)* |
| Odoo param | `ai_agent.whatsapp_api_secret` = same secret ✓ |

**Architecture with webhook enabled:**
```
Customer sends WA msg
        │
        ├──► MassivaMóvil ──webhook POST──► Odoo /ai-agent/webhook/whatsapp
        │                                        │
        │                                   Process immediately
        │                                   (Claude + reply in ~3s)
        │
        └──► Poll cron (5 min) ──GET /api/get/wa.received──► Dedup catches it
                                                              (already processed)
```

**Odoo webhook controller:** `POST /ai-agent/webhook/whatsapp` (`auth='none'`, `csrf=False`)  
**Secret validation:** Compares `data.secret` from MassivaMóvil payload against `ai_agent.whatsapp_api_secret` param. Simple string equality (not HMAC).

**Remaining action for production:**
- Add Nginx location block on prod server (`10.124.0.3`) routing `/ai-agent/` → Odoo container port
- Update MassivaMóvil webhook callback URL from testing to production URL
- Test: `curl -X POST https://odoo.ueipab.edu.ve/ai-agent/webhook/whatsapp -d '{"secret":"wrong"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"` → expect JSON error, NOT 404

#### GAP 4: System Crons — TARGET_ENV and DRY_RUN Flags

| Cron File | Script | Current TARGET_ENV | Current DRY_RUN | Production Change Needed |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| `ai_agent_bounce_processor` | `daily_bounce_processor.py` | testing | **LIVE** (`--live`) | Change `TARGET_ENV=production` |
| `ai_agent_email_checker` | `ai_agent_email_checker.py` | testing | **LIVE** (`--live`) | Change `TARGET_ENV=production` |
| `ai_agent_escalation` | `ai_agent_escalation_bridge.py` | testing | **LIVE** (`--live`) | Change `TARGET_ENV=production` |
| `ai_agent_resolution` | `ai_agent_resolution_bridge.py` | testing | **LIVE** (`--live`) | Change `TARGET_ENV=production` |
| `ai_agent_wa_health` | `ai_agent_wa_health_monitor.py` | testing | **LIVE** (`--live`) | Change `TARGET_ENV=production` |
| `customer_matching` | `customer_matching_daily.py` | testing | **LIVE** (`--live`) | Change `TARGET_ENV=production` |

**Status:** All 6 crons are LIVE. Only `TARGET_ENV` switch needed for production.

**Note:** `ai_agent_email_checker` and `ai_agent_hr_email_checker` both lack `TARGET_ENV` in their cron — they read Odoo config from JSON (which has hardcoded `testing` db). Must update JSON or add `TARGET_ENV` support.

#### GAP 5: Akdemia Pipeline Path Dependencies

Not a blocker — all scripts run on dev server. Only `TARGET_ENV` switch needed. See [Akdemia Data Pipeline](AKDEMIA_DATA_PIPELINE.md).

#### ~~GAP 6: Escalation Bridge & Email Checker are DRY_RUN~~ RESOLVED (2026-02-14)

Both scripts switched to **LIVE** on 2026-02-14.

#### GAP 7: Freescout API Migration (Optional)

Not a blocker. Direct MySQL works. See [Freescout API Migration Plan](FREESCOUT_API_MIGRATION_PLAN.md).

#### GAP 8: Credit Guard Production Calibration

- Claude spend is **cumulative (lifetime)**, not monthly
- Default `claude_spend_limit_usd = 4.50` (90% of initial $5 credit)
- When topping up credits, MUST increase this limit proportionally
- WA sends checked against MassivaMóvil Plan 500 subscription

**Action:** Set appropriate `claude_spend_limit_usd` based on actual Anthropic credit balance at go-live.

#### GAP 9: Bounce Log Data (Initial Load)

Production has NO bounce logs yet. The `daily_bounce_processor.py` script will create them from Freescout data on first run.

**Action:** Run bounce processor against production first (DRY to preview, then LIVE). This creates the bounce log records that Glenda will work from.

#### GAP 10: Testing Environment Lockout

When production goes live, testing must stop processing to avoid double-sending WhatsApp messages (both envs share the same MassivaMóvil account).

**Action:**
1. Set `ai_agent.active_db = 'DB_UEIPAB'` on production
2. Set `ai_agent.active_db = ''` on testing (Odoo crons self-skip)
3. Update all cron scripts: `TARGET_ENV=production`

#### GAP 11: Partner/MC Data Drift (prod vs test)

Initial analysis (2026-02-14) showed 19 partner + 22 MC diffs. Most resolved by Phase 5 sync. Recent sync (2026-03-04): 3 employee contacts synced (Daniel Bongianni, Rafael Pérez, Lorena Reyes).

**Status:** Not a blocker. Production will catch up when Phase 5 runs against production data.

#### GAP 12: Odoo Cron Configuration *(updated 2026-04-19)*

Testing has **7 Odoo crons** (inside the module):

| Cron | Testing Interval | Production Recommendation | Activate Day 1? |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Poll WhatsApp Messages | 1 min | **5 min** (webhook handles real-time; polling is fallback only) | ✓ Yes |
| Check Conversation Timeouts | 1 hour | 1 hour | After 48h stable |
| Credit Guard | 30 min | 30 min | ✓ Yes |
| Archive Attachments | 2 hours | 2 hours | ✓ Yes |
| Stagger HR Data Collection | 30 min | 30 min | Phase 2 (after HR data collection launch) |
| Stagger Payslip Ack Reminders | 30 min | 30 min | ✓ Yes (if payslip ack skill active) |
| Auto-Resolve Ack Reminders | 30 min | 30 min | ✓ Yes (if payslip ack skill active) |

**Action:** After webhook is live, set poll cron to 5 min. Enable crons per column above — do not activate timeouts until system is stable for 48h.

#### GAP 13: HR Data Collection Skill

The `hr_data_collection` skill depends on `ueipab_hr_employee` module (GAP 1) and has its own Stagger cron.

**Consideration:** Enable in Phase 2 (after core system is stable in production). Requires HR employee records to be populated before launching batch collection campaigns.

#### GAP 14: Payslip Ack Reminder Skill (New — v1.31.0) *(NEW 2026-04-19)*

The `payslip_ack_reminder` skill is new (v1.31.0, 2026-04-19). It requires:
- `hr.payslip.is_acknowledged` field on payslips (from `ueipab_payroll_enhancements`, already in prod)
- `hr.payslip._get_acknowledgment_url()` method (from `ueipab_payroll_enhancements`, already in prod)
- Two new crons: Stagger Payslip Ack Reminders + Auto-Resolve Ack Reminders

**Consideration:** Can be activated from day 1 alongside core module. No additional module dependencies beyond what's already deployed in production.

### Production Migration Sequence *(completed 2026-05-10)*

```
Phase 0 — Security Hardening ✓ COMPLETE (2026-05-10)
  [✓] Hardcoded production credentials removed from all 6 bridge scripts
  [✓] /root/.odoo_agent_env_prod created (chmod 600) with current API key
  [✓] /var/www/dev/.odoo_agent_env_prod created (chmod 640, root:www-data) for Akdemia pipeline

        Credential is no longer active (current key: 6e65cfeb... in production.json).

Phase A — Prepare ✓ COMPLETE (2026-05-10)
  [✓] Backup: /backup/DB_UEIPAB_20260510_pre_ai_agent.dump
  [✓] ueipab_hr_employee v17.0.1.0.0 → /home/vision/ueipab17/addons/
  [✓] ueipab_bounce_log v17.0.1.4.0 → /home/vision/ueipab17/addons/
  [✓] ueipab_ai_agent v17.0.1.31.2 → /home/vision/ueipab17/addons/

  [✓] PyMuPDF (fitz) installed in production container (pip install PyMuPDF)
  [✓] __init__.py updated: search path now includes /etc/odoo (container mount of config/)
  [✓] Modules installed in order: ueipab_hr_employee → ueipab_bounce_log → ueipab_ai_agent
  [✓] Config loaded manually via Odoo shell (post_init_hook searched wrong path)
  [✓] ai_agent.active_db auto-set to 'DB_UEIPAB' ✓
  [✓] ai_agent.claude_spend_limit_usd = 4.15 (90% of ~$4.61 remaining)
  [✓] 6 skills loaded, 7 crons created (5 active Day 1, 2 deferred)

Phase B — Webhook ✓ SKIPPED (deliberate — poll cron sufficient, no nginx config needed)
  [✓] MassivaMóvil webhook configured 2026-04-19 (testing URL only)
  [~] Production nginx /ai-agent/ block: DEFERRED — add when webhook latency matters
  [~] Production callback URL update: DEFERRED
  NOTE: Poll cron at 5 min provides adequate response time for all current use cases.

Phase C — Configure & Dry Test ✓ COMPLETE (2026-05-10)
  [✓] All 5 host AI agent crons switched to production (env file sourced)
  [✓] Akdemia pipeline wrapper updated for production credentials
  [✓] All 5 bridge scripts dry-run verified against production (Odoo + Freescout + WA)
  [✓] ai_agent.active_db = '' on TESTING Odoo → crons self-skip

Phase D — Go Live ✓ COMPLETE (2026-05-10)
  [✓] ai_agent.dry_run = False on PRODUCTION
  [✓] Odoo crons — Day 1 active: Poll (5 min), Credit Guard (30 min),
        Archive (2h), Stagger Payslip Ack (30 min), Auto-Resolve Ack (30 min)
  [✓] Check Conversation Timeouts: INACTIVE — enable after 48h stable
  [✓] Stagger HR Data Collection: INACTIVE — Phase 2
  [✓] Bounce processor LIVE: 2 bounce logs created (dcontrerasperez82, lacruzde@pdvsa)
  [✓] All host crons LIVE targeting production
  [ ] Enable Check Conversation Timeouts after 48h stable ← PENDING
  [ ] Monitor Credit Guard for 48h

Phase E — Post-Launch Optimization (PENDING)
  [ ] After 48h stable: enable Check Conversation Timeouts cron
  [ ] Phase 2: enable Stagger HR Data Collection cron
  [ ] Credit Guard: raise claude_spend_limit_usd on each Anthropic top-up
  [ ] Optional: nginx /ai-agent/ proxy block + MassivaMóvil production webhook URL
```
